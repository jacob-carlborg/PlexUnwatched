Finder sync extension that shows unwatched/partially watched items from Plex.

The intention is that the Plex items are either located on the computer running
the extension or are mounted using a remote file system (SMB/AFP).

Use the host application to configure the extension. `Remote Path` is one of
the folders from one of the Plex libraries as configured in Plex. `Local Path`
is the corresponding path where the Plex folder is accessible on the computer
running the Finder extension.

Currently only Movie and Video Plex libraries are supported.
